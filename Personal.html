  <p class="mt-3">In the above photo you can see me posing with my beautiful wife. My wife's 
    name is Daniela, and we have been married for 3 years now. My wife is from Colombia,
  which is a blessing in many ways. It's a wonderful place to visit, and was able to learn Spanish
with her. This was only possible because prior to meeting my wife I went on a mission
for the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-Day Saints in the country of Portugal. So I learned 
Portuguese first, and the two are similar and it served as a great starting point for Spanish.</p>

<h3>Personal hobbies</h3>
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>I like to exercise and stay in shape as best as I can. I like to use weights a lot, but I 
  also know the importance of cardio, especially because I have a very sedentary life, from 
working in a chair and being in college. So I try to keep myself moving, I take our dog on a 
walk everyday, I try to run on the treadmill everytime I go to the gym. I don't 
film myself working out but I took a video of a shoulder press I was 
particularly proud of, one rep for 135lbs. Not good quality but it serves
to show this aspect of my life.</p>

<h4>Animals</h4>
<p>I always grew up with animals, I had 2 dogs, 4 cats, a fish, and some mice. Now 
  if you are surpised don't worry, it was not all at once. Only one dog at 
  a time, at most 2 cats, and the fish and mice were never at the same time.
  Anyways, now that I am all grown my wife and I decided to get a dog, you can see
  her in the photo below, her name is Sunny, and she is a australin shepherd 
  mixed with a poodle, or an aussiedoodle. She is a cute little ball of energy.

<h4>Cars</h4>
<p>I like working on cars a lot, I don't have any project cars or 
  sporty cars, but I just like fixing and maintaning our two cars. 
  We have a hyundai elantra 2005, and a ford f150 2003. I have done a 
  lot of work between the two. On the elantra I have changed the radiator,
  tie rods, brakes, lightbulbs, spark plugs, spark plug wires, and air filter. On the f150 I have changed the 
  exhaust manifold gasket, exhaust manifold bolts, fuel injectors, instrument 
  cluster, fuel filter, tie rod ends, pitman arm, and the idler arm. Along 
  with doing regular maintenance work like oil changes, tire rotations, oil filters, etc. 
  That's just what I have done so far, I plan on replacing control arms in the 
  f150, and probably the wheal bearings in the hyundai. I don't have a photo 
  of the elantra but you can see the f150 below, along with a video I took talking
  about the fuel injectors.
